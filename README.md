This is a converted version of the Authenticated PRTG network Monitor script that comes with Kali
I did not make this script, I simply converted it to work with Kali

Use this is you are getting the following errors when trying to run the original:
46527.sh: line 11: $'\r': command not found
46527.sh: line 12: syntax error near unexpected token `$'\r''
'6527.sh: line 12: `usage()
